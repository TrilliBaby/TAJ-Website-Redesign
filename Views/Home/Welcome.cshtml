        <h1>Welcome</h1>
        <p>
            Tax Administration Jamaica (TAJ) proudly operates as the country’s premiere revenue collecting agency. In keeping with our mission, our primary goal is to foster voluntary compliance, collect the revenue due in an equitable and efficient manner, contribute to a competitive business environment and facilitate economic growth and development.<br/><br/>

            Through excellent service by our highly skilled staff, and in capitalising on the strengths of the organisation, our primary focus, as we strive to accomplish the broad goals and objectives set out by the Ministry of Finance and Planning and in general the people of Jamaica is one that embodies the mantra, “Working together to serve you Even better”.<br/><br/>

            In an effort to stay focused and committed, the management and staff of TAJ is devoted to its mandate. We have reached an important juncture in the history of the Administration, giving birth to a more efficient and unified organisation – lending relevance to the reform process as “we change the way we do business”. The operations of the former Inland Revenue Department (IRD), Taxpayer Audit and Assessment (TAAD) and the Tax Administration Services Departments (TASD) are now consolidated to form a single Tax Administration Jamaica.<br/><br/>

            This consolidation will undoubtedly impact positively on the efficiency and effectiveness in the Administration. TAJ’s enduring spirit has been driven by the pursuance of further excellence, especially as we now operate as a single TAJ.<br/><br/>

            Considerable emphasis has been placed on improving operations by making it more customer-focused. This move is in keeping with the realigned Vision of TAJ   becoming: “A World-Class Tax Administration”. Since transforming into a new organisation, TAJ has made significant strides to make it even easier for persons to do business with the tax authorities. Companies, self-employed persons, partnerships, provident societies, other organisations and the general public now have additional options to access information, file returns and pay their taxes. With the introduction of our Customer Care Centre (CCC), Large Taxpayer Office (LTO), TAXREM-text message reminders and the expansion of our online services, we continue to grow from strength to strength. The Tax Administration continues to work to improve the services offered to the taxpaying public, to make it even easier - as tax is everybody’s business.<br/><br/>

            The new Tax Administration Jamaica has recommitted to the ideals and precepts which have strengthened the bonds the Administration have shared for many years. The modernisation exercise is expected to continue through to 2014, and we will continue to raise the bar and work together to serve you EVEN better.<br/><br/>

            It is with pleasure that we welcome you to our new-look website, which offers added functionality and is easier to navigate. Do feel free to contact us and share your thoughts on our mission and operations and how we may serve you EVEN better.
